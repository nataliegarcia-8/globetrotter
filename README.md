Welcome to Stateside! We are a unique travel application that allowers users to do more than just plan a trip, instead offering users the ability to not only plan trips, but add information about that trip to the app while on the trip, and then, upon completion of their trip, users may view a memory of their experience. On top of these three main features, users will also find a map feature that saves the locations the user has visited on a map for easy access. In terms of technologies used, one can find modern React.js making use of multiple components to create an easy to interact with UI and UX. Other technologies used include; AWS (Amplify / Cognito), Node.js, HTML, CSS, JSX, jQuery, MongoDB (Database), and others. To view the deployed application, please click on the following link:
